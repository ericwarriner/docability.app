The CCPA defines “Personal Information” as ”information that identifies, relates to, describes, is reasonably capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, with a particular consumer or household.”

              Verification procedures
              When exercising your rights, we may need to verify your identity before responding to your request, such as verifying that the email address from which you send the request matches your email address that we have on file. Authentication based on a government-issued and valid identification document may be required (e.g. drivers license).
              If you have authorized someone else to make requests on your behalf, we will require that you provide notarized statements confirming the identity and authority of that person.
